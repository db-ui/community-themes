= Next generation MicrositeMaster Theme

This repository contains a theme for DB microsites. It's used for internal sites, but for example also for the https://github.com/dbsystel/tech-stories[DB Systel Tech Stories].

== Local development

Make sure you have wget installed.

NOTE: The arch -x86_64 statements force mac os to use rosetta in order to emulate an x64 environment, which seems to be needed for jbake to work properly. You can omit this when working on a windows machine.
