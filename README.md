# Community themes

Within this Repository the DB Web Community will store and provide common community based (style) themes for further systems and frameworks.

## Things to keep in mind

### Developed for and driven by the community

This is mainly a platform providing the space for a common basis of shared themes for popular products and frameworks; their development
is mainly driven by the community and adapted out of the work done in projects and through the huge amount of feedback and especially PRs
that we're gaining out of the community. So please support us in any way possible, this is greatly appreciated!

Besides the Web Community that will moderate and approve change requests, there won't be a central team working on maintaining of these themes,
but their related, individual teams code owners, that are listed in their folders `CODEOWNERS` file.

## Deutsche Bahn brand

For any usage outside of Deutsche Bahn websites and applications you must remove or replace any Deutsche Bahn brand and
